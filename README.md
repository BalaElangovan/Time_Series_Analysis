# Time_Series_Analysis
Time Series Data Analysis is a way of studying the characteristics of the response variable with respect to time as the independent variable. 
To estimate the target variable in the name of predicting or forecasting, use the time variable as the point of reference. 
A Time-Series represents a series of time-based orders.

Problem Definition
we will build a model to predict the depth to groundwater of an aquifer located in Petrignano, Italy. The question we want to answer is
What is the future depth to groundwater of a well belonging to the aquifier in Petrigrano over the next quarter?
The wells field of the alluvial plain between Ospedalicchio di Bastia Umbra and Petrignano is fed by three underground aquifers separated by low permeability septa. The aquifer can be considered a water table groundwater and is also fed by the Chiascio river. The groundwater levels are influenced by the following parameters: rainfall, depth to groundwater, temperatures and drainage volumes, level of the Chiascio river.
Indeed, both rainfall and temperature affect features like level, flow, depth to groundwater and hydrometry some time after it fell down.
